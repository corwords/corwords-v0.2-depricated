# Introduction to corwords
The mantra behind corwords simply put: to make content management great again by "bringing your own content." There are so many 
content management systems (CMS) available today, but each require that you use their server, their technology and abide by 
their structure. 

Corwords is different. The idea behind corwords is that content can live all over the place. You may have a content management
team that enjoys storing content in OneDrive or Dropbox. Or a technology team that uses GitHub, VSTS, or BitBucket. You may have 
content written in Markdown, but you may also have content written in a Microsoft Word document. Corwords allows you to bring your
content together.

This project is rather young and will evolve over time. Feel free to submit pull requests, feature requests, or issues.
